# async-race

## [Task description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/async-race.md#cross-check) 
Create a SPA that will manage the collection of cars, control their engines and show race statistics.


## [Deploy](https://maxxx1mhr.github.io/async-race/async-race/)
(Note: to be able to watch working version ones need to start up a local server with cars data. The code and instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).)
